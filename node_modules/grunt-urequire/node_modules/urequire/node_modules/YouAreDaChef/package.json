With method combinations, you can easily separate concerns.\n\nFor example:\n\n    class Wumpus\n        roar: ->\n            # ...\n        run: ->\n            #...\n\n    class Hunter\n        draw: (bow) ->\n            # ...\n        quiver: ->\n            # ...\n        run: ->\n            #...\n\n    hydrate = (object) ->\n        # code that hydrates the object from storage\n\n    YouAreDaChef(Wumpus, Hunter)\n    \n        .before 'roar', 'draw', 'run', ->\n            hydrate(this)\n            \n        .after 'roar', 'draw', ->\n            @trigger 'action'\n    \nThere must be more to it than that\n---\n\nYes there is, there's a [Quick Start Guide][qsg] and a discussion of the [special sauce], YouAreDaChef's inheritance model.\n\n[qsg]: https://github.com/raganwald/YouAreDaChef/blob/master/docs/quick.md\n[special sauce]: https://github.com/raganwald/YouAreDaChef/blob/master/docs/special-sauce.md\n\n\nIs it any good?\n---\n\n[Yes][y].\n\n[y]: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3067434\n\nI don't believe you!\n---\n\n*C'mon, meta-programmed code is read-only. It looks good, but when it comes time to debug or modify anything, it's a nightmare to step through it in the debugger and figure out what's going on.*\n\nThat's often the case, but starting with version 1.0, YouAreDaChef is designed to make code that's easy to write, not just easy to read. Instead of blindly patching methods with wrapper functions, YouAreDaChef stores all of the \"advice\" functions in a special data structure in the class. You can inspect each class separately. You can provide names for the advice you add to methods, which makes it easier to keep track of the advice you have provided. Since you have the advice and can inspect it, you can write unit tests for your advice and debug the advice you have provided more easily. The `.inspect` function does add some code complexity to the YouAreDaChef library, but it makes writing and debugging code written with the YouAreDaChef library much easier.\n\nCan I use it with pure Javascript?\n---\n\n[Yes][js].\n\nCan I install it with npm?\n---\n\nYes:\n\n    npm install YouAreDaChef\n\nWill it make me smarter?\n---\n\nNo, but it can make you *appear* smarter. Just explain that *guard advice is a monad*:\n    \n    YouAreDaChef(EnterpriseyLegume)\n    \n      .when /write(.*)/, ->\n        @user.hasPermission('write', match[1])\n\nGuard advice works like a before combination, with the bonus that if it returns something falsely, the pointcut will not be executed. This behaviour is similar to the way ActiveRecord callbacks work.\n\nYou can also try making a [cryptic][cry] reference to a [computed][comp], non-local [COMEFROM][cf]. \n\n[cf]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM\n[cry]: http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/m4r4t/aspectoriented_programming_in_coffeescript_with_a/c2yfx6w\n[comp]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goto#Computed_GOTO\n\nI might not need all of its awesomeness\n---\n\nHave a look at [method-combinators].\n\n[method-combinators]: https://github.com/raganwald/method-combinators\n\nWhere can I read more?\n---\n\n[Quick Start Guide][qsg]  \n[Separating Concerns in CoffeeScript using Aspect-Oriented Programming][blog]  \n[Implementing Garbage Collection in CS/JS with Aspect-Oriented Programming][gc]  \n\n[js]: https://github.com/raganwald/YouAreDaChef/blob/master/lib/YouAreDaChef.js\n[gc]: https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2012/03/garbage_collection_in_coffeescript.md#readme\n[blog]: https://github.com/raganwald/homoiconic/blob/master/2011/11/YouAreDaChef.md#readme\n\nIn memoriam\n---\n\nYouAreDaChef's method advice is loosely based on Lisp Flavors, specifically the inheritance of `before` and `after` advice plus the overriding of `default` advice (called `daemon` in Flavors). [Dan Weinreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Weinreb) (d. 2012) played an important role in the development of Lisp. He is missed by many.\n\npost scriptum\n-------------\n\nI'm writing a book called [CoffeeScript Ristretto](http://leanpub.com/coffeescript-ristretto).
