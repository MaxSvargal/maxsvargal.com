  p This is the face of your product of service. 
  p Nevertheless the surface's beauty should not run counter the convenience and usability.
  p The main aim of web-design is to deliver the message. 
  p I have been dealing with it for seven years and still I see every new project as a challenge for my skills. 
  p Are you ready to offer me another one?

  h2 Front-end 
  p First of all, I am a JavaScript programmer and CSS virtuoso. 
  p I write code for browsers and servers on the basis of Node.js. 
  p In my work I use Node.js actively for assembling projects ( Grunt, Bower, RequireJs) and transcompiling such ones as Jade, Haml, Stylus, Sass, CoffeeScript. 
  p I do love outstanding trio of CoffeeScript, Stylus and Jade because of its fleetness, neat structure and rich syntax. 
  p Native JavaScript is my temptation.
  p I do my best not to use any libraries if it is possible. I enjoy creating my own ones respecting works of other Great Creators.

  p Platform choice depends on the specific features of the project. This is why I learn and catch up with a wide range of languages, technics and frameworks such as Ruby (RoR), Clojure, Python, Meteor.js and other. 
  p What else? ...databases! MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis, LevelDB.
  p Leaving the personal development, I study all of mentioned mostly for the sake of my front-end job
  p Node.js is my choice. This platform could be easy called an up-to-date one. And it seems to drive me mad and no other way. 
  p I devote my future projects to it.

  p There are a lot of tools helping me in my work. I cannot imagine a working process without my best friend Git and my usual ally Linux.
  p Even though I have just started to study test-driven development (TDD/BDD) I expect the results will be more than fruitful.
